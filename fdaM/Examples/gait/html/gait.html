         <p>The Motion Analysis Laboratory at Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, collected these data, which consist of the angles formed
            by the hip and knee of each of 39 children over each child's gait cycle.  The data analyzed here have been the subject of
            many papers, but our reference is Oshen, et al (1989) Gait analysis and the bootstrap. Annals of Statistics, 17, 1419-1440.
         </p>
         <p>Time is measured in terms of the proportion of the individual gait cycle, which we have translated into values of $t$ in $[0,1]$.
            The cycle begins when the heel of the limb under observation strikes the ground. Both sets of functions are treated as being
            periodic.
         </p>
         <p>The gait cycle as displayed in these data has four phases:</p>
         <div>
            <ol>
               <li>At the heel strike, the other foot is still in contact with the floor,   and the first phase lasts until the other foot leaves
                  the floor, which   occurs at about 19% of the gait cycle.  The weight of the body is   transferred to the side being plotted.
               </li>
               <li>The other foot leaves the floor moves from behind the limb being   plotted to the point where the other heel strikes the floor.
                   During   this phase the plotted leg is bearing all of the weight of the body.   The knee angle is near zero to minimize muscle
                  loading during this time   of maximal load.  The hip angle continues to decrease, however, as the   leg continues to move
                  to the rear.  This phase lasts about 31% of the   gait cycle, so that for about 62% of the cycle the body is being   supported
                  by only one leg.
               </li>
               <li>The other heel strikes the floor, but the foot on the plotted side   is still in contact with the floor.  Since gait is nearly
                  bilaterally   symmetric, this point is roughly at the mid-point   of the cycle.  This phase lasts until the plotted foot 
                   leaves the floor at about the 68% point of the cycle.
               </li>
               <li>When the plotted foot leaves the floor, all the weight is transferred   to the other side, and this phases lasts until the
                  plotted heel again   strikes the floor.
               </li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p>There are many interesting questions concerning these data.</p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>We want to consider registering the data.  The starting point   for each record is the time of the heel strike, but this is
                  an   interaction with the environment that may a complex relationship to   the dynamics for heel and knee angle, as well as
                  to their interaction.
               </li>
               <li>What are the relative importances of amplitude and phase variation in   these gait cycles?  If we want to diagnose gait problems,
                  which of   should we focus on?
               </li>
               <li>Where does most of the energy come from that defines gait?  What is   the relative importance of the hip and the knee?</li>
               <li>Heel strikes and toe lifts mark boundaries in the gait cycle, but   can we see these plus any other markers directly in the
                  hip and knee   angles?
               </li>
               <li>To some extend knee angle must be dependent on hip angle, since one   suspects that the swing of the lower leg from back to
                  front in   preparation for the next heel strike is partially propelled by hip   motion.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <h2>Setting up the data for analysis<a name="5"></a></h2><pre class="codeinput">fid  = fopen(<span class="string">'hip.dat'</span>,<span class="string">'rt'</span>);

fid  = fopen(<span class="string">'knee.dat'</span>,<span class="string">'rt'</span>);
knee = reshape(fscanf(fid,<span class="string">'%f'</span>), [20,39]);
</pre><p>The hip and knee angles were observed at 20 equally spaced time points. Here we center them within the time interval, but
            the original report was not clear as to whether the first point was at the beginning of the interval.  For our purposes, it
            does not matter which where we assign the first value, and we will see that the data require substantial registration in any
            case.

</pre><h2>Estimating a functional data object<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>We use a Fourier basis, and for symmetry reasons the number of basis functions must be odd.  Hence this basis actually has
            more basis functions than there are observations per record.  This does not pose a problem for the computation, however.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">gaitbasis = create_fourier_basis([0,1], 21);
</pre><p>We will apply a small amount of penalty to the roughness of the data. There is a certain amount of error due to both measurement
            and the discretization of the angles, and angles are consequently only accurate to within about three degrees.
         </p>
         <p>Since the data are periodic and even roughly sinusoidal, it is reasonable to penalize the total harmonic acceleration.  Here
            we set up the linear differential operator that annihilates a shifted sinusoid with period one.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">harmaccelLfd = harmaccel(gaitbasis);
</pre><p>Now we set up functional parameter object to define amount of smoothing. We need to have smooth and stable estimates of the
            second derivatives of these curves, and our choice of 1e-7 as thesmoothing parameter value was settled on by looking at the
            quality of the fit using plotfit_fd, and by inspecting the second derivative curves.

         <p>The plot shows two sharp cusps, both with near zero acceleration. Zero acceleration applies constant velocity, and indicates
            that forces acting on the hip at relatively neutralized at that point. The first cusp is close to the initial heel strike.
            Counting times, the second cusp comes at 37.5% or 3/8 of the gait cycle, about at the mid point of the second phase, when
            the leg is carrying the body's weight alone and leg is fully extended.  The fact that a number of time points coalesce at
            this time indicates that this is an interval of stationarity, rather than a point, and corresponds roughly to the second phase.
             After this point, the hip angle undergoes a large nearly harmonic swing in its values, with the large diameter of this swing
            indicating a great deal of energy.

%% Introduction to the gait data for 39 boys

%%
% The Motion Analysis Laboratory at Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, 
% collected these data, which consist of the angles formed by the hip and 
% knee of each of 39 children over each child's gait cycle.  The data 
% analyzed here have been the subject of many papers, but our reference
% is Oshen, et al (1989) Gait analysis and the bootstrap. Annals of 
% Statistics, 17, 1419-1440.

%%
% Time is measured in terms of the proportion of the individual gait cycle, 
% which we have translated into values of $t$ in $[0,1]$. The cycle 
% begins when the heel of the limb under observation strikes the ground. 
% Both sets of functions are treated as being periodic.

%%
% The gait cycle as displayed in these data has four phases:
% 
% # At the heel strike, the other foot is still in contact with the floor,
%   and the first phase lasts until the other foot leaves the floor, which
%   occurs at about 19% of the gait cycle.  The weight of the body is 
%   transferred to the side being plotted.
% # The other foot leaves the floor moves from behind the limb being 
%   plotted to the point where the other heel strikes the floor.  During
%   this phase the plotted leg is bearing all of the weight of the body.
%   The knee angle is near zero to minimize muscle loading during this time
%   of maximal load.  The hip angle continues to decrease, however, as the
%   leg continues to move to the rear.  This phase lasts about 31% of the
%   gait cycle, so that for about 62% of the cycle the body is being
%   supported by only one leg.  
% # The other heel strikes the floor, but the foot on the plotted side
%   is still in contact with the floor.  Since gait is nearly bilaterally
%   symmetric, this point is roughly at the mid-point
%   of the cycle.  This phase lasts until the plotted foot

% * We want to consider registering the data.  The starting point
%   for each record is the time of the heel strike, but this is an
%   interaction with the environment that may a complex relationship to
%   the dynamics for heel and knee angle, as well as to their interaction.
% * What are the relative importances of amplitude and phase variation in
%   these gait cycles?  If we want to diagnose gait problems, which of
%   should we focus on?
% * Where does most of the energy come from that defines gait?  What is
%   the relative importance of the hip and the knee?
% * Heel strikes and toe lifts mark boundaries in the gait cycle, but
%   can we see these plus any other markers directly in the hip and knee
%   angles?
% * To some extend knee angle must be dependent on hip angle, since one
%   suspects that the swing of the lower leg from back to front in
%   preparation for the next heel strike is partially propelled by hip 
%   motion.

% to within about three degrees.

% Since the data are periodic and even roughly sinusoidal, it is

% up the linear differential operator that annihilates a shifted
